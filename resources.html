        <h1>Resources Used</h1>
        <h2>Principle Resource</h2>
        <h3>Harrisson Kong's Coursera guided project.</h3>
        <p>I followed Harrisson's project as a code-along to produce the index.html and resume.html pages.</p>
        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        <p>I used the GitHub docs page https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github for hints to add this code to an existing GitHub repository. Then I followed normal procedure of git push. Initially git would not make the push because of the pre-existing code. I tried a few things unsuccessfully then (thanks to the hints given by git itself and git push --help) tried git push --force -u origin main and that worked. It's probably best practice not to use --force lightly but the previous index.html contained only the text 'Hello World'. It was a proof of concept exercise from a Codecademy lesson.</p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>At first the site wasn't updating and doggedly kept showing the original index.html. I followed this: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/19713 (via DDG request: 'pushed new code to github but old files show in browser')'. The trick was to unpublish as said by @ghost.</p>
